# JustScreenshot

*Dirty-hack, but works. Please submit PR if you know better solution*

Primitive application for triggering system android screenshotter. It uses [AccessibilityService](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService) for taking screenshots.

Useful for mapping hardware buttons to screenshot action when it not possible due to vendor limits. For example on my Sony Xperia 1 III I can remap 'custom' button to launch any app, but not for actions like creating screenshots.

## Installation

1) Install APK from releases
2) Enable Accessibility feature: Settings -> Accessibility -> Screenshot -> Use Screenshot
